# Time-Series-Analysis-(Phys-411)
This is a summary of the coding skills I acquired during my study of Physics 411. 

Each Python notebook contains a brief description of the goal the notebook was attempting to accomplish. 

Most notebooks use the weather data provided to us (for use in Physics 411) by the Greater Victoria School-Based Weather Network {all geographical information comes from their website (http://www.victoriaweather.ca/), and the chain of webpages associated with it}. This data is stored in the folder named "Data". 

Notebooks with the word "demo" in the title, create their own data set to demonstrate the intended point.

All images stored in "Images", are from the final project notebook.
